Introduction 
Plants require multiple belowground resources including water and a variety of nutrients. Differences in both how plants acquire these resources and how they respond to variability in the availability of soil-borne resources contribute to niche differentiation and the maintenance of diversity (Levine and HilleRisLambers 2009, Holste et al. 2011).  Because the seedling stage is a vulnerable time in trees’ life histories during which populations suffer elevated mortality (Ribbens et al. 1994), many studies have evaluated how water and nutrients affect seedling growth rates (Yavitt 199?,Baraloto et al. 2006), allocation to roots versus shoots (Burslem et al. 1996, Canham et al. 1996), physiological process rates (Graciano et al. 2005), and relationships with symbionts such as mycorrhizae and nitrogen fixing bacteria in Fabaceae (Birhane et al. 2015).  These studies typically find that responses to multiple belowground resources are often species-specific and also may depend upon whether above- or belowground organs are considered (Freschet et al. 2013).  Thus, we still lack a general framework for understanding the joint effects of belowground resources on seedling performance, particularly in environments with large seasonal or temporal variability in soil moisture and nutrient availability (Lodge et al. 1994), such as seasonally dry tropical forests. 
 DESCRIBE THE TYPES OF RESPONSES… (Table 1). 


Paragraph 2 introduce TDF..  
 
Seedling growth in TDF is strongly constrained by water availability and is typically restricted to the wet season (Gerhardt 1993, Maza-Villalobos et al. 2013).  However, studies have also shown that TDF seedlings respond positively to increased nutrient availability (Huante et al. 1995a, Huante et al. 1995b, Ceccon et al. 2003).  Surprisingly, few studies have investigated how nutrients and soil water jointly affect tropical dry forest tree seedlings.  There are a number of possible responses to increased water and nutrients, from additive, synergistic, antagonistic, or no response. 
* SYNERGISTIC if plant didn't respond to each resource individually, but does respond to them added together, OR if LRR for both resources together is outside the 95% CI for an individual resource 
 
*** what does it mean if the resources are not balanced?  Can a plant take advantage of added water or nutrients, if it does not have the other resource? 

Paragraph 3 Goals and Specific Objectives 
Here we examine the effects of water and nutrient addition on biomass gain and leaf trait of eight species from the tropical dry forest of Costa Rica. We used three fixers and five non fixers species. We hypothesized that water and/or nutrient addition will cause plants to shift their leaf traits in order to uptake the new resources available, which will lead to a biomass gain. (ref)

We addressed the following questions:

(Q1) What is the relative influence of water vs. nutrient availability on tropical dry forest seedling performance.
(Q2) How does increased nutrient or water availability influence water- and nutrient-use traits?

For (Q1) we predict....
We used a diverse sample of tropical dry forest tree species from different functional groups in a seedling pot experiment to answer the following questions: 1) how do biomass allocation and functional traits change during seedling development, 2)  
how do added water and/or nutrients affect growth, physiology, water use efficiency, functional traits, and relationships with symbionts, and are these responses additive, antagonistic or synergistic, and 3) which traits are correlated, and does this vary among species?  We predicted that  
 
Methods 
Study site and species 
Our experiment took place between June to November, 2015, in a shade house located at the Estacion Experimental Forestal Horizontes, Area de Conservación Guanacaste, Costa Rica (10°420 46″ N, 85°350 44″). Rainfall is highly seasonal, with a dry period of 5-6 months. Mean annual precipitation at nearby Sector Santa Rosa is 1729 mm and mean temperature is 25 C (Becknell and Powers 2014), although Horizontes likely has lower rainfall than Santa Rosa (Gutiérrez-Leitón 2013). Our study occurred during one of the driest years on record (Cooley et al. 2019), wherein rainy season rainfall was less than X of average due to the very strong El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event of 2015; thus we considered ambient rainfall as a drought.  We used 8 species that belong to 5 different families: Enterolobium cyclocarpum, Gliricidia sepium, Hymenea courbaril, Dalbergia retusa, Swietenia macrophylla, Simarouba glauca, Tabebuia ochraceae and Pachira quinata (Table 2). Collectively, these species represent the full range of functional trait variation that defines different tropical dry forest plant functional types in ecosystem simulation models (Xu et al 2016), including nitrogen (N) fixing and non-N fixing legume species.  
Seed germination, growing conditions  
The shade house was covered with a 50% shade cloth. All the seeds sown directly into pots containing a soil mixture of 2 parts of locally collected soil and 1 part sand. To improve germination rates, we applied two different treatments to the seeds. Enterolobium seeds were subject to water baths alternating from boiling to cold water for 30 seconds for breaking the seed coat. All other species were soaked in water overnight.  
Seeds were sown directly into pots in early June, 2015.  Following germination and establishment, pots were thinned to one seedling per pot.  All plants received supplemental water when needed.  After ~12 weeks, an initial harvest of four individuals per species was made (see Methods below).  Watering and/or fertilizer treatments on the remaining seedlings were started two days later, and were imposed for 12 weeks (N = 4 plants per species per treatment) prior to harvest.   

Watering and fertilization treatments 
At 12 weeks, plants were randomly assigned to one of four treatments: control (no additions), nutrient addition, water addition, water + nutrient addition.  Water additions consisted of 500 mL added every two weeks.  The nutrient addition treatment consisted of a commercial fertilizer containing NPK and complete micronutrients.  Nutrient addition rates were corresponded to 150 kg N ha-1 yr-1, prorated to the duration of the experiment (3 months). Fertilizer was dissolved in water and added to the surface soil in the pots every two weeks in 20 mL doses with a syringe. 
Soil moisture 
Soil moisture readings were taken in all pots immediately prior to watering treatments and then ~1 day following watering, and these measurements were repeated six equally spaced times during the growing season after the treatments began. This allowed us to quantify the magnitude of the watering effect on soil moisture, and also allowed us to know whether elevated soil moisture in the watered pots persisted beyond two weeks. These measurements were made with a SM150 Soil Moisture Sensor (Delta-T Devices, Ltd, Cambridge, England).  
Gas exchange measurements
We measured resource-acquisition and hydraulic traits related to how plants acquire carbon and use water in all the individuals. Prior harvesting the plants, we measured maximum photosynthetic capacity  at 1200 par (Amax; μmol CO2 m−2 s−), stomatal conductance (gs; mmol m−2 s−1)) and instantaneous water use efficiency (WUE; μmol CO2 mmol H2O−1) with a LCi portable photosynthesis system (ADC Bioscientific Ltd. Hoddesdon, UK). 
For SLA, leaf area-based nitrogen concentration and  leaf mass-based nitrogen concentration one leaf per plant was scanned and dried at ~60° C for 48 h and weighed. 

SLA was calculated as Leaf area divided by Leaf weight.    
This same leaf, after measuring SLA, was ground to fine powder for Leaf Nitrogen concentration and their stable isotope Delta 13 C quantifications. Delta 13C was measured on a PDZ Europa ANCA-GSL elemental analyzer interfaced to a PDZ Europa 20–20 isotope ratio mass spectrometer (Sercon, Cheshire, UK) at the Stable Isotope Facility at the University of California, Davis. We then calculate leaf mass-based nitrogen concentration and leaf area-based nitrogen concentration by dividing Leaf nitrogen concentration by its dry weight and leaf area respectively. 




Canopy nitrogen content. 
Biomass and Growth 
Height was measured every two weeks in all the individuals with the goal of calculating the Relative and Absolute growth rate of each plant. We calculated RGR as (log(Hf) - log(Hi))/(t2-t1) and AGR as (Hf) - Hi)/(t2-t1) where Hi is the initial height of the plant and Hf is the final height of the plant.
After the gas exchange measurements, we harvested the plants for biomass quantification. First,  we divided the plants into leaves and stems, then the roots were carefully extracted and washed from the pots. All roots, stems and leaves were dried at ~60° C for 48 h and weight. 
Data analysis 
We calculated these for legumes and non-legume taxa separately, as numerous studies have suggested that the direction and magnitude of trait correlations differ between legumes and non-legumes (Powers and Tiffin, 2010; Pineda-Garcia et al 2016, Adams et al 2016). 
For answering What is the relative influence of water vs. nutrient availability on tropical dry forest seedling performance, we used a mixed model approach  with interaction effect between treatment and fixer category (Fixer- non fixer) as the main effects, initial height as covariate to control for the differences in height between plants and species as a random effect.  Total dry biomass, root, stem and leaves dry weights, above and belowground biomass, RGR, AGR, specific leaf area, Nmass, Narea, Canopy Nitrogen content ,and foliar 13C (as an integrated metric of water use efficiency) were used as  response variables.  
This allowed us to interpret any changes in seedling allocation or traits after we imposed the watering and fertilization treatments within the context of developmental changes over the growing season.  
Next, to understand  how does increased nutrient or water availability influence water- and nutrient-use traits?


Results


(Q1) What is the relative influence of water vs. nutrient availability on tropical dry forest seedling performance.

Total Biomass

For the fixers species,plant total biomass increased significantly to the addition of water, nutrients and both (F and p-values). The addition of water increased 29% the total biomass compared to the ambient treatment. While the addition of nutrients increased the total biomass 63% and the addition of both, water and nutrients, increased the total biomass in 70% compared to the ambient rain treatment.

For non-fixers species, only the  nutrients and nutrients plus water treatments increased significantly the total biomass. In the case of the nutrients treatment, this increased 39% the total biomass while the addition of both, increased 41%. The addition of water had no significant effect on the total biomass.




Above and belowground biomass

Aboveground biomass for fixers and non-fixer increased significantly when nutrients and nutrients plus water were added compared to the ambient rain treatment. In the case of the fixer species, aboveground biomass increased 47% when nutrients were added and 82% when nutrients plus water were added. For non-fixers, aboveground biomass increased 31% when nutrients were added and 44% when nutrients and water were added. 

We found that belowground biomass increased significantly in all treatments for fixer species. The addition of nutrients increased 79%, the addition of water increased it 37% and the addition of both, increased 58%. While for non fixer species, only the addition of nutrients had an effect over the belowground biomass. which increased belowground biomass by 48%. 

Biomass partition: root, stem and leaf biomass

Fixer’s root mass increased significantly in all treatments. Nutrient addition increased root mass 78% compared to the ambient rain treatment while water increased it 37% and nutrients plus water increased it 58%. For non fixers, only the addition of nutrients increased significantly root biomass in 47%.

Stem mass for fixers increased significantly 13% in the plus nutrients treatment and 34% in the nutrients plus water treatment. Non fixer’s stem mass did not change significantly in any of the treatments.

Total leaf mass increased significantly for fixers and non-fixers in the nutrient and nutrients plus water treatments when compared to the ambient rain treatment.For fixers, the addition of nutrients increased 40% and the addition of nutrients plus water increased 73%. For non-fixers the addition of nutrients increased 43%  whilst the addition of water and nutrients increased it 50%.

Absolute and relative growth rates 

The plus nutrients and plus nutrients and water treatments increased 61% and 77% the absolute growth rate, respectively and 57% the relative growth rates in both treatments for fixer species (f values pvalue) while for non fixer species, the only the addition of nutrients increased significantly the relative growth rate (f values pvalue) 


Gas exchange 

For fixer species, we found that the addition of nutrients decreased Amax by 15% (f values pvalue). The addition of water increased Amax and stomatal conductance by 14% (f values pvalue) and 35% (f values pvalue) and decreased WUEi by 30% (f values pvalue). Finally the addition of nutrients and water decreased WUEi  by 31% (f values pvalue).

For non fixer species, none of the treatments had effect over the Amax but the plus water and plus nutrients and water treatments increased the stomatal conductance 132% and 123% and decreased WUEi 50% and 52%, respectively  (f values pvalue).

Leaf Traits

From the five traits measured, only Canopy Nitrogen content NMass responded to the treatments. Canopy Nitrogen Content, increased for fixers 45% when nutrients were added and 60% when nutrients and water were added. While for non fixers this same trait increased 81% and 71% respectively. In the case of Nmass, this trait decreased 18% when water was added for the fixer species.
